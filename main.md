#### **Multi-Select Field**

- We understand that sometimes you need more specific options. That's why we've introduced a versatile multi-select
  field.
- In this field, you can type in keywords related to your property, and our system will provide you with appropriate
  options. Feel free to choose multiple options, and if you accidentally select something you didn't mean to, you can
  easily delete it.
- We've categorized the options to make your selection process more organized. Finding the perfect filter attributes has
  never been easier!

eye-catching property listings.

dash of unpredictability. You never know what hidden gem it might reveal!

the attention of potential buyers in unexpected ways.

A picture is worth a thousand words, and we want you to see the difference our filters make. That's why we've added a
new image preview feature.
